# IDATT2502 -  Applied machine learning with project

## Course content
Data representation: representation of various data sources such as images, sound and text, current techniques for processing data.

Unsupervised learning: various clustering algorithms, reduction of dimensions, and other current methods.

Supervised learning: including logistic regression and different types of neural networks.

## Learning outcome
### Knowledge

The candidate can give an account of:

- different ways of representing data
- different methods for grouping and classifying data
- which machine learning methods are appropriate to use for given problems
- limitations of machine learning

### Skills

The candidate can:

- create full-fledged machine learning solutions using a framework
- use representation algorithms that make it easier for machine learning methods to give better results for a given data set
- select and adapt a machine learning method that is relevant to a given problem
- assess whether machine learning methods can give good results for a given problem based on a given data set

### General competence

The candidate must be able to find and adapt solutions to new problems based on previous applications of machine learning.


## Prerequisites

- Python:
  
  Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
  You can download and install Python from the [official Python site](https://www.python.org).
  
- Pip:
  
  Check if Pip is installed. Pip is typically installed alongside Python.
  
  You can verify its installation by running the command ```pip --version``` in your terminal or command prompt.


## Installation and Running

To install and run any of the task folders, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `requirements.txt` file is located.

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to keep the dependencies isolated:

   - Run the command to create a virtual environment (assuming you have venv installed):

     For Windows:
     ```batch
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the project dependencies using pip and the requirements.txt file:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command will install all the required packages specified in the requirements.txt file.

5. Choose the task folder you want to run (e.g., folder 01).

6. Navigate into the task folder:
   ```shell
   cd 01
   ```
7. Run the desired task.

Repeat these steps for any other task folders you want to install and run.
